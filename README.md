# Angular-project
This project includes 3 parts:
1. A page for pets - the user can add a pet, edit a pet, delete a pet, save changes on the database, fetch the pets which are saved in the database
2. A blog page - the user can read, add, edit an article, fetch the articles saved in the database and update articles on the database
3. A page for pet hotel - the user can make a booking which is saved in the database

At the beginning the user must do a registration with email and password. After successful registration  the user logs in and gets the right to see the 3 pages described above.

The resolution of my screen is 1366x768 (for the CSS part).
